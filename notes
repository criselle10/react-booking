react native is not the same with react.js, react native is use for moble development.(focus on movile dec)

What is ReactJS?
--ReactJS is javascript library used to create user interfaces.

What is the syntac mostly used to create element in ReactJS?
--JSX is used mostly in ReactJS but we can also create react element without the use of JSX.

What is JSX?
--javascript + XML (combination of JS and HTML/XML)

JSX and its Babel compiler, transpiles/translates your XML/HTML syntax to JS objects.

What is a react component?
--It is a piece of frontend development codes that are:
    -Reusable
    -Independent

How many kinds of components are in ReactJS? -2
    -Functional
    -class-based

Components are mostly function which return React elements. It can also  receive data like a parameter 
but not exactly parameter: We can receive PROPS.

Undefined VS Not Defined?
    --Undefined simply means, that the variable has been declared 
    but no value was initialized.

    --Not Defined means that the variable you are referring simply
    does not exist.

=======================================
mounting > displaying elements
rendering > reading code and logic/applying code
unmounting > dealing with one page

PROPS(properties) = way of passing data from parent component to child component.
      = react object that is passed between components.
      = props are read only, cannot be mutated/change.

Note: 
    -You can pass multiple props from a parent component to child component.
    -The reason why we simply don't get the whole prps object in a child component
    is so that we can choose the props that we need in the component.
    -You can pass different data types as a prop not just objects.

What allows us to save/track information within a component?
--->States or sttae variables allow us to save/track information within component.
Each state is within a component and is independent from other states in other
component.

How do we create a state?
--->by using the useState() react hook.
const [<state variable>,<setter>] = useState(<initial value of the state variable>)

--The useState() react book actually returns 2 things: state variable and the setter function.
--The useState() react hook returns an array with 2 things, the state varible and the setter
function for the state variable. Thus, the need for array destructuring.

======================================================
React.js was originally designed and conceptualized to create single-page
application. By default, React.js does not route to other pages.
